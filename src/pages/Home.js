      <p style={{ gridArea: 'c' }}> Welcome to my virtual CV! I'm Kerttu, a recent graduate from the University of Jyv채skyl채. This page may give some kind of idea of the things I'm into. I have a lot of interests in the IT area which has made it hard to navigate and choose the paths to pursue and develop more skills in. But there are things that I've enjoyed more that others. I like web development, UI/UX and usability design. I also enjoy working with databases, queries and statistical analysis. Software testing is something that also interests me.  </p>
