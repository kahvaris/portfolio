      <p>      
      I've studied information technology in the University of Jyväskylä. Bachelors I completed in 2022. I continued straight to master's. Master's degree I got done in fall 2024. During bachelor's studies I learned basics of many technologies and languages. The master's provided more in depth knowledge but also a lot of new.
