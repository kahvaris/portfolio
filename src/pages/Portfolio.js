      <p> I worked as a part of the Test Automation team. Most used technologies were Jenkins to monitor the test runs and their health. Zabbix to monitor how is the health of the test servers. Git, Gerrit and Azure DevOps for project management and version control. I enjoyed my summer and in the end got good feedback. </p>
      <p>I've been a part of a couple of game projects. They show off more of my graphic design skills in both 3D-modeling and 2D art.</p>
